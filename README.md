# final-project

**Due: Friday, May 12. End of day.**   
100 Points 

The final project is opportunity to apply your knowledge in computational physics to a scientific area of your choosing.  Each student must submit a unqiue and original work.  The project must have the following elements: 

- The report is written as a Jupyter Notebook using the Python language 
- An overview describing the problem/study and the overal approach
- Make use of a self-generated module
- Use one or more classes and/or functions from your module
- The workflow is clearly annotated with Markdown blocks
- Use latex somewhere
- Show one or more plots as part of the result
- Results are clearly described using Markdown blocks
- The notebook must run and generate the results shown in the committed respository

You are encouraged to use packages other than numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. If packages are not part of Anaconda, you must clearly describe the dependencies and the install procedure so that it can be duplicated by the grader. 

For a project to score full marks, it must demonstrate an effort that would correspond to 20% of your total grade.  A rough guide would be about twice that of hw-05. 

Grading will assess if each of the criteria above are met and will be combined with a subjective evaulation of the project.  Check your midterm project feedback! 

You can commit and push to the 'main' branch.  I'll give feedback on your project/grade in the 'Feedback' Pull Request.
